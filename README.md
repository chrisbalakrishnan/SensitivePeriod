Two files are uploaded here. Counts.txt is the expression count data for all the experimental birds (the full datamatrix). This was subsetted for various contrasts within treatment conditions. THe uploaded "allbirds" R code contains the basic code used for pairwise contrasts. I've also uploaded the subsetted data for contrasts within treatment. Sorry the code is not pretty.
